# Treehouse Task Ten

For this project, I created a web application for listing, adding, updating, and deleting books in a library application, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

## Instructions

Open the folder locally in terminal and type `npm install`, then `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
